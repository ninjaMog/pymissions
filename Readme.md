# PyMissions

## About

Pymissions is a learning project that's hopefully going to help me relearn python, including learning a bit about pygame, numpy, maybe even a bit of scipy and a few algorithms.

I'll be very gradually implementing the game rules for: [Space Cadets: Away Missions
](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/124827/space-cadets-away-missions) a game I had a lot of fun with recently, and thought it would be interesting to try and implement.
